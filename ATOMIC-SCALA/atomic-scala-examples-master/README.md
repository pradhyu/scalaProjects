Atomic Scala Examples
=====================

Examples from the book *Atomic Scala* by Bruce Eckel &amp; Dianne Marsh. Also
includes the necessary code to make it work within Typesafe Activator.

When you download this package (see the "download ZIP" button on the right when
viewing the page https://github.com/AtomicScala/atomic-scala-examples), you'll
get a package with a number of directories; the only one you need to follow the
book examples is the directory titled "examples." You can ignore the rest of the
files and directories, which are used by Typesafe Activator.

(This is for the 2nd edition of the book, but you can still find the examples for Version 1.1 of the book in **examples-V1.1**).

Move the "examples" directory into your C:\AtomicScala folder.

Within the "examples" directory you will find all the example files from the
book, as well as several build scripts (for different platforms and/or shells):

  - **Testall.bat** for Windows command shell
  - **Testall.ps1** for Windows PowerShell
  - **Testall.sh** for Macintosh and Linux

Full instructions on installation and use are in the book itself.

If you *want* to use Typesafe Activator instead, simply run the **activator**
shell script (Macintosh & Linux) or the **activator.bat** batch file (Windows),
which you will find in the main directory of the unzipped download.
